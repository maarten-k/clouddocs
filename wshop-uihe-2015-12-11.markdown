## <a name="preparation"></a>Preparation

Participants should bring a laptop that is connected to the Internet and has a functioning browser. Prior experience in [Linux commands](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) will help but is not a prerequisite. 

So, what you need for this tutorial:

* A computer with full Internet access.
* A browser (Chrome or Firefox will do nicely).
* An SSH client.
  * Linux and Mac users: don't have to install anything; an SSH client is installed. Use `ssh` in a [terminal](http://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it).
  * Windows users: download and install [git for windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/). Depending on your OS installation, choose between `Git-2.6.3-32-bit.exe` or `Git-2.6.3-64-bit.exe`.


## <a name="hands-on"></a> Hands-on
The hands-on tutorial has two parts: part A and part B. The exercises in part A will give you a first grasp for the _basic_ usage of HPC Cloud. Once you have completed and understood part A, then continue to part B with some more _advanced_ examples on parallel applications, such as XBeach.
