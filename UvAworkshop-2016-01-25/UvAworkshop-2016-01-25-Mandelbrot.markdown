# UvA workshop 2016-01-25 - master/slaves: Mandelbrot

> ## Warning: Under construction

This is an exercise in the Tutorial [UvA workshop 2016-01-25](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25).
**You should have completed (and understood)** [UvA workshop 2016-01-25 - Part A](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25-partA) and [UvA workshop 2016-01-25 - Part B](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25-partB) before trying this exercise.

## Preparation (for local use)

Make sure that you have installed:

* Java, at least version 7 (a.k.a. 1.7)
* An X11 client.
  * Linux and Mac users normally don't need to install anything as X11 is on board. However, the newest Mac OS releases might not have X11.app installed. In that case, install XQuarz from [here](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/).
  * Windows users: see [X11 on Microsoft Windows](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25-MS-X11)
