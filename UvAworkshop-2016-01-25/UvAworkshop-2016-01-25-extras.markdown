These are the extras of the Tutorial [UvA workshop 2016-01-25](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25).
**You should have completed (and understood)** [UvA workshop 2016-01-25 - Part A](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25-partA) and [UvA workshop 2016-01-25 - Part B](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25-partB),  before trying these extras.

The exersises below can be done in any order and you can do none or more, depending on your enthusiasm and available time.

You will find several _Food for brain_ questions in each exercise that you might encounter when working with _Parallelization_ techniques. Perform many tests, observe the results, think about answers.

* [OpenMP: calculating _pi_](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25-OpenMP)
  Using a simple algorithm to calculate _&pi;_ as an example, you see the impact of parallelizing with OpenMP with different approaches

* [MPI: xBeach](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25-xBeach)
  XBeach is a two-dimensional model for waves hitting the shore, using MPI to parallelize the computations.

## Assignment

For those who submit an assignment on the HPC Cloud course, please run both exercises [OpenMP: calculating _pi_](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25-OpenMP) and [MPI: xBeach](UvAworkshop-2016-01-25-xBeach) and answer the `Food for brain` questions. For bonus marks you can aswer also the questions `BONUS food for brain`.
