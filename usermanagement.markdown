# User management

As a group administrator you can create users, change their passwords and set and change their quotas for number VM's running, CPU usage and memory usage. To do this, change your 'view' to the 'groupadmin' view. See the page on the [user interface](user-interface#switch-views) for more information on how to do this.

All user operations can be done from the 'Users' page (see the icons at the top of the windows in the HPC Cloud interface).

 * By clicking on the + icon in the large green box, you can add a user by specifying his/her username and password. Here, you can also immediately set quotas, by chosing 'Manual' under 'Define Quotas'.

On the 'Users' page, all users if your project are visible, including you yourself. You can click on the username to edit the user. Now there are three icons on the same line:

 * One with 4 horizontal lines. Clicking on this icon allows you to change the user quotas
 * One with a lock. Clicking on this will let you change the password
 * One with a garbage bin on a red button. With this, you can delete the account.
